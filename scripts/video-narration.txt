Let's have an honest conversation about Large Language Models in software engineering.

First, a clarification: what we call "AI" is actually a misnomer. LLMs are statistical text predictors, not artificial general intelligence. The marketing has hijacked the term, misrepresenting decades of diverse research.

Like many developers, I gave LLMs an honest effort. There were moments of genuine awe, watching code generate in seconds. But those moments were rare. More often, I found myself convinced it was my fault for not crafting the perfect prompt.

The hype makes you feel inferior for not making it work. But here's what the research actually shows:

The METR study found developers were actually 19% slower with AI assistants, despite feeling 24% faster. 72% of organizations have suffered production incidents from AI-generated code. 76% of developers use these tools but don't trust the results.

This is the productivity paradox: you're not saving time, you're just trading less typing for more time reading and untangling code.

So what do we do? I don't want to discount LLMs entirely. The potential is real. But we need to be pragmatic.

That's why I built the AI Assistant Starter framework. It's not a silver bullet. It's a structured approach with three principles:

First, humans remain in control through mandatory approval gates. No code changes without explicit consent.

Second, structure reduces chaos. Workflows, phases, and role-based constraints leave less room for hallucination.

Third, context must persist. Project memory survives sessions, so you stop re-explaining everything.

The framework includes 20 workflows covering the full development lifecycle, 10 role-based chat modes that constrain what the LLM can do at each phase, and 17 domain guidelines that codify your coding standards.

It works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and other tools. Write your instructions once, use them everywhere.

Let's be clear about limitations: this won't make LLMs reliable. They're still probabilistic. You still need to review everything. But it reduces the verification burden and prevents scope creep.

The craft of software engineering remains human. LLMs are tools, not replacements.
