description: Understand code without making changes. Read-only exploration of codebase structure, patterns, data flow, and dependencies. Use when asked "how does X work" or to investigate code before planning.

# Explore

> **Purpose:** Understand code without making changes
> **Mode:** Read-only — do NOT modify any files
> **Usage:** `/explore [scope flags] <question>`

## Constraints

- **Read-only** — Use only read, glob, grep operations
- **Never edit files** — Changes must be delegated to implementation skills
- **Never run state-changing commands**

## Scope Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--files=<paths>` | Focus exploration on specific files/directories |
| `--project=<path>` | Project root for monorepos |

**Examples:**
```bash
/explore --files=src/auth/ how does login work
/explore --files=src/api/ what patterns are used
/explore how does the state management work
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Scope

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If `--files` provided, focus exploration on those paths.

### Step 2: Search for Relevant Files

Based on the question, search for relevant files:

```bash
# Search for keywords
grep -rn "keyword" src/

# Find files by pattern
find . -name "*.ts" -path "*/auth/*"
```

### Step 3: Read and Analyze

1. Read key files identified
2. Trace imports and dependencies
3. Understand data flow
4. Note patterns and conventions

### Step 4: Summarize Findings

```markdown
## Exploration: [Question]

### Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | [what it does] |

### How It Works
[Explanation of the code flow]

### Patterns Found
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

### Dependencies
- [What this code depends on]
- [What depends on this code]

### Considerations
- [Things to be aware of]
- [Potential issues]
```

## Output Requirements

- **Key files involved** — List with purpose
- **How the code works** — Clear explanation
- **Patterns to follow** — Conventions found
- **Considerations** — Things to be aware of
