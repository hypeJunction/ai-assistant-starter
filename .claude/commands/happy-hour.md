# Happy Hour

Follow the workflow instructions in **[happy-hour.prompt.md](../../.ai-assistant/workflows/happy-hour.prompt.md)**.

This is your end-of-session routine for wrapping up work cleanly:
1. Ensure all changes are covered by tests
2. Run validation checks
3. Perform self-review
4. Create clean commit
