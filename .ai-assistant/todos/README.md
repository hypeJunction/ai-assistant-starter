# Todos

This directory contains tracked technical debt, deferred work, and improvement opportunities.

## Purpose

Use todos to document:
- Shortcuts taken during development
- Technical debt to address later
- Improvement opportunities
- Deferred features or fixes

## File Naming

Use kebab-case with descriptive names:
- `refactor-api-client.md`
- `tech-debt-config-loading.md`
- `improve-error-handling.md`

## Template

See [_template.md](./_template.md) for the standard todo format.

## Workflow

Create todos using: `/create-todo` or follow [create-todo.prompt.md](../workflows/create-todo.prompt.md)

## Lifecycle

1. **Created** - Todo documented with full context
2. **In Progress** - Actively being worked on
3. **Completed** - Work finished
4. **Cancelled** - No longer relevant
